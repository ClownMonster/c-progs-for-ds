 Object execution for each of the program is also provided 

 You can create your own object executions ...recomended not to use ./a.out
 use your own object files,so that execution will be understandable


 *****default object execution ****

 s.exe -> singleLL.c

 d.exe -> doubleLL.c

 c.exe -> Single Circular LL ->circularLL.c

 dc.exe -> Double_circular.c

 for stack execution you can create the object as
 gcc/cc  -o <<object name>> stack.c  {{ you can have other compilers too}}
